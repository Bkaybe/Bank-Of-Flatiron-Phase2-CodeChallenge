### PHASE 2 : BANK OF FLATIRON CODE CHALLENGE

## PREREQUISITES

- For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

- Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

### Challenge Topics

- Working with state using the `useState` hook
- Effects in React using the `useEffect` hook
- Rendering and re-rendering in React
- React Events
- Working with forms and inputs in React
- Consuming APIs/Communicating with a server in React.
- CRUD operations in React.

### Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

### Pre-requisite Data

## Running the program

- To run this program you can click on the link below to get to the deployed website

  [https://bank-of-flatiron-phase2-code-challenge.vercel.app/](https://bank-of-flatiron-phase2-code-challenge.vercel.app/)

- To run it on your local machine you will need to open the folder containing the project in vscode then in your terminal run the following command

  ```console

      Serving ./public directory if it exists

      Endpoints:
      http://localhost:3000/transactions
  ```

  - All you have to do now is to now is to start the react application using the following command in your terminal and you'll have run the program.
